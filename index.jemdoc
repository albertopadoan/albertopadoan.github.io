== About me

I received the Laurea Magistrale degree (cum laude) in [https://lauree.dei.unipd.it/lauree-magistrali/lm-ingegneria-dellautomazione/ Ingegneria dell'Automazione] from the [https://www.unipd.it/ University of Padova] in 2013 and the Ph.D. degree in Control Theory from the [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/research/control-and-power/ Control and Power Group] at [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/ Imperial College London] in 2017, under the supervision of [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.astolfi Alessandro Astolfi]. In 2018, I then joined the [http://www-control.eng.cam.ac.uk/ Control Group] and [https://www.sid.cam.ac.uk/people/dr-alberto-padoan Sidney Sussex College] as a Research Associate at the [https://www.cam.ac.uk/ University of Cambridge] to collaborate with [https://sites.google.com/site/rsepulchre/publications?authuser=0 Rodolphe Sepulchre]. In 2021, I became a member of the [https://control.ee.ethz.ch/ Automatic Control Laboratory] at [https://ethz.ch/en.html ETH Zürich], working primarily with [http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~floriand/ Florian Dörfler] and [https://control.ee.ethz.ch/people/profile.john-lygeros.html John Lygeros].

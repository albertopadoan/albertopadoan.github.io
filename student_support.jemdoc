==== Help during exams
Students registered with the [https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/centre-for-accessibility Centre for Accessibility] may request various types of academic accommodations. Please make requests as early in the term as possible to ensure arrangements are in place.

==== Managing stress
Personal concerns such as stress, anxiety, relationships, depression, or cultural adjustment can affect academic success and well-being.
